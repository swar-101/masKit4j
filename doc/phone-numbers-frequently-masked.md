When it comes to fintech companies, there are certain types of phone numbers that are more likely to need masking, primarily because they may be associated with sensitive financial transactions or customer identity. Let's break down the numbers that typically require masking and why:

### 1. **Mobile Numbers**
   - **Why Mask?** Mobile numbers are directly linked to users' identities and are often used for two-factor authentication (2FA), account recovery, and notifications related to financial transactions. Since they are sensitive, they need to be masked in logs, reports, and external communications to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Masking Approach:** Typically, the first 6-8 digits are masked, leaving only the last 4 digits visible for validation purposes.
   - **Example:** `+91 9876543210` → `+91 987******10`

### 2. **Landline Numbers**
   - **Why Mask?** Similar to mobile numbers, landline numbers may be used for customer support or certain account verifications. They are also tied to individuals or businesses and can be a vector for identity theft or fraud if exposed.
   - **Masking Approach:** The same as mobile numbers, mask most of the number, leaving the last few digits visible.
   - **Example:** `+1 212-555-1234` → `+1 212-555-****`

### 3. **Toll-Free Numbers**
   - **Why Mask?** Toll-free numbers are commonly used by businesses (including fintech companies) for customer support and service lines. While they may not be tied directly to a user’s identity, they are often used in business transactions and can be associated with customer accounts or financial data.
   - **Masking Approach:** Masking is used for the same reason as landline and mobile numbers, especially in logs or communications where the full number is not needed.
   - **Example:** `+1 800-555-1234` → `+1 800-555-****`

### **Which Numbers Do Fintech Companies Mask Most Frequently?**
Fintech companies typically focus on masking numbers that are associated with **personal customer data** or **transactions**. The primary types of numbers that are commonly masked in fintech scenarios include:

- **Mobile numbers**: Since they are directly tied to users’ accounts, are used for verification, and can be involved in sensitive transactions (e.g., OTPs for payments, account recovery).
- **Landline numbers**: These may not be used as often for authentication but still carry personal or business-related data, especially in customer support contexts.
- **Toll-free numbers**: Used for customer service, support, or transaction inquiries, and may be exposed in various communications, thus requiring masking for privacy and security.

### **Numbers That Do Not Need Frequent Masking**
- **Emergency Numbers**: Emergency numbers like `911` or `112` are **not typically masked** because they are public-facing and used for urgent situations. Masking these could hinder emergency response.
- **Business Numbers** (e.g., corporate phone numbers): Business numbers that are published publicly for contact purposes don't require frequent masking, unless they are specifically tied to a user's account or transaction.
  
For fintech companies, **mobile numbers**, **landline numbers**, and **toll-free numbers** are the primary categories that require masking most of the time due to their association with user identities, financial transactions, and account security. These types of numbers should be masked in logs, reports, and communications where full access is not needed, protecting users' personal information and ensuring privacy.
